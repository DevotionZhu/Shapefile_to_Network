# Shapefile To Network
Construct street network from Shape-file and find number of shortest paths from origin to destination.

# Overview
This python module allow you to get information of number of delta shortest pahts from origin to destination where delta is some constant specified by the user. You can also do some analysis over the network like finding degree, centrality of the nodes in graph.

# Files Documentation
<b> Core Scripts </b> <br /> <br />
*GraphConvertor.py* - This module will take the input line shapefile and the path of output directory <br />
*ShortestPath.py* - This module will calculate the number of *alpha* times shortest path from origin to destination in the graph

<b> Internally Called Scripts </b> <br /> <br />
*BufferedGraph.py* - This module create the square (*buffer*) around the point geometry specified by user <br/>
*GraphSimplify.py* - This module will clean and remove all the unusable edges from the graph <br/>
*MultiDiGraphConvertor.py* - This module will convert the MultiDiGraph to SimpleGraph <br/>

# How to use
<ol>
  <li> Run <i>setup.py</i> to install all the required packages <br/></li>
  <li> Convert the shapefile into MultiDigraph using <i>GraphConvertor.py</i> </li>
  <li> Use the ouptut network generated by <i>GraphConvertor.py</i> in <i>ShortestPath.py</i> for finding number of shortest path     from <i>start_tuple</i> to <i>end_tuple</i></li>
